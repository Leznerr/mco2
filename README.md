# Fatal Fantasy: Tactics

This project is a simple Java-based tactics game used for demonstrations.

## Building

A standard JDK 21 or higher is required. Compile all sources using:

```bash
javac $(find . -name '*.java')
```

## Running

After compilation, run the `Main` class:

```bash
java Main
```

Tests are minimal; see `MainMenuTest.java` for a small example.
